Cozy Ui
=======

A clean Ui SDK designed to build [Cozy](http://cozy.io/) apps.

If you plan to build a webapp to run on Cozy, you'll probably want ti use a
simple and elegant solution to build your interfaces without the mess of 
dealing with complex markup and CSS. Then Cozy Ui is here for you!

It relies on Stylus for styling and jQuery for Ui behaviors. You can add it as
a library in your project to use it out-of-the-box.

[Cozy](http://cozy.io) is a platform that brings all your web services in the
same private space. With it, your web apps and your devices can share data
easily, providing you with a new experience. You can install Cozy on your own
hardware where no one profiles you.
